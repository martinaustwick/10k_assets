Ten thousand letters of love assets

Various bits of animation code written in Processing 1.5 to create Grass, Rain, Zeppelins, etc.

Happy to bulk out the readmes if people have questions.

For most bits of code, pressing "m" starts and stops the movie capture; this will tend to slow things down.

You'll want to re-open any resulting videos in Quicktime to compress them.
